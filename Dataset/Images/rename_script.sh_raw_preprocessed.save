In the script you provided:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the directory containing the images to rename
directory="/path/to/your/images"

# Specify the suffix to add to the filenames
suffix="_preprocessed"

# Go to the directory
cd "$directory"

# Loop through all files in the directory
for file in *; do
    # Check if the file is a regular file
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        # Rename the file by adding the suffix
        mv "$file" "${file%.*}$suffix.${file##*.}"
    fi
done

echo "Renaming complete."
```

The `directory` variable is where you specify the path to the directory containing the images you want to rename. It's the directory that the script will navigate to using `cd` before performing the renaming.

In the script, you need to replace `"/path/to/your/images"` with the actual path to the directory where your images are located. For example:

```bash
directory="/home/your_username/Desktop/my_images"
```

This is the directory where the script will look for files to rename. The `cd "$directory"` command makes sure that the subsequent file operations are performed in that directory
